# What are we doing at GSoC17?
 
Since the Google Summer of Code 2017 has started last month, we want to explain this year’s goals and methods and keep you up to date about our progress.
 
With Green Navigation, we want to provide value and therefore, we are huge supporters of open source. This way, we want to make GreenNav available to everybody and everyone and try to extend it where possible.
 
This year, we have decided to use a scrum-like methodology. The basic idea behind this is easy: Writing software is difficult and developers usually have to reconsider and rethink everything. To make this easier, the mentors prepare user stories derived from the features the projects consist of, and put them onto boards. We will work on those and after two-week-periods, the mentors will approach the students with code reviews, some feedback for the past and for the next sprint planning. The last sprint will be used for integration work, documentation, and some last finishes.
 
Luckily, we are able to realize six projects this year, which the students were able to pick from our ideas page. We will be working on: 
 
## Range Viewer & Range Anxiety
Most customers of electric vehicles have a fear of running out of energy because recharging an electric vehicle takes longer than refueling a combustion engine vehicle. We want to solve this problem with a precise computation and visualization of the vehicle’s range.
 
## Persistence Layer
To store the OSM data in an efficient way, we need a persistence layer. The database has to store, for instance, weather, traffic, and height profiles and to perform intelligent data retrieval to optimize the IO for routing. Also, it should be easy to extend, so we can implement new routing algorithms easily. 
 
## Routing Server
This is the most essential part of GreenNav. Amongst other things, the routing server should be able to account for weather and height differences, and collaborate closely with the database project. 
 
## Traffic Avoidance
We want to give accurate energy consumption predictions by taking traffic into account because by avoiding traffic, you can preserve energy.
 
## Predicting Energy Consumption
To predict the energy consumption of certain types of vehicles regarding the parameters of the taken route, we want to utilize machine learning methods. 
 
During the Google Summer of Code, we will keep you updated every few weeks with our progress, so feel free to follow us on Google+.
