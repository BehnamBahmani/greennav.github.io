# Announcement GSoC 2017

We are happy to announce that Green Navigation is participating in this year's Google Summer of Code again! 
Thanks to last year's contributions, we made substantial progress with our front end and aim to focus on our back end this year.

In addition to that, the GreenNav team will work on:

- developing integrations using the CAN-bus
- optimizing the range forecast leveraging Machine Learning

## What has changed since last year? 
Our team has gotten bigger (and therefore better) and we have gained new perspectives thanks to GSoC 2016. The most apparent progress is our cool UI with React.js, featuring visualizations, overlays and many small details. Our best student from GSoC 2016 has stayed for good and will be mentoring this year!

Furthermore, we aim to be completely open source, which is why we moved to Gitter and are thinking about moving from GitHub to GitLab. 

Thanks again to everyone who has contributed last year. You are all welcome to help us working on this year's goals.

Join us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/greennav/)
